# The following is a list of configuration options.
#
# NOTE: I had originally created these lists as a way of preserving the order
# of options in the destination config file, but now I'm managing
# these values in a way that ruins this order, so don't let the listiness
# fool you.  Keycloak's config shouldn't care about the order though, so
# it should all be fine.
#
# Each entry is a dict with a `name` and `value` key.  This will be rendered
# in the config file as:
#
#   name=value
#
# for each entry.
#
# These will replace the existing values in keycloak_config_default or
# be added to the list if not found.
#
# If you include a `state: absent` record in these values, you can have
# a named entry removed from the final list.
